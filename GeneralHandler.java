/**
 * Since an interface cannot hold "data members", we create an abstract class to hold the reference of either the Queue or the Stack, in order to be able to perform the given menu operation on it. This reference is provided into the constructor: the idea is to use constructor overloading, so that an object of such (inherited) class, will be able to hold a reference to either a Stack or a Queue - but not both! Either of these constructors MUST be used, in order to create an object - this guarantees that EXATLY ONE reference (Queue/Stack) is there to work with! Which one? The one that is NOT null (one will be initialized by the constructor), whereas the other one will be initialized to null by default (default initialization for instanse/class variables of "reference type"). 
 * In this way, we can have generic operation, like adding an item, but the implementation will need to check which element is being served (Stack or a Queue), while the other one will be null! The reason for creating this class, and letting all the other handler classes inherit from it (rather than having each of the handlers implement the "IntQueueStackHandler" interface) is prevention of repetitions/redundancy: If we didn't have this class, then each one of the handlers would need to implement the "IntQueueStackHandler" interface and define two references (Queue and Stack references) on its own! In this abstract class way, we define these two references once, then get all the other handlers simply inherit from it - thus, no duplications in the definition of the handlers! All the handlers inheriting from it need to do is simply to initialize these two references, by invoking the "super" constructor, and, in addition, to implement the abstract method processRequest with their own specific implementation!
